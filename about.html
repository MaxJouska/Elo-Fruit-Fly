                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="par2">Hello my name is Max Jouska I have been playing League of Legends since the near end of season 6 and my passion for this game has been always been as high as ever and will continue to be.
                    My favorite champions to play are Master Yi, Yasuo, Zed, Yone, Viego, Zed, and a few more with the first ones being my most played champions.
                    As you could probably tell by the styling of the website my favorite is Master Yi. <br>Now lets talk about what makes me qualifed to be your booster.
                    I have played through every rank from bronze to challenger. So I know what it takes to get to the top and I can help you get there too.
                    Now lets talk about why I started this website and why I am taking this path of ELO boosting over climbing the solo queue ladder myself.<br>
                    The reason I started ELO boosting is because I want to take a break from climbing and try a different approach to the game. I also want to help
                    people who are hardstuck and can't seem to get out of their current rank. I want to help them get to their dream rank and make them happy.
                    While also making a little bit of money on the side. <br>I understand boosting prices are quite honestly kind of outrageous so I decided that here at
                    Elo Fruit Fly
                    they will be cheap and affordable for the average league player.</p>
